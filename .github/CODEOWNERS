# This is a CODEOWNERS file that specifies default approvers for pull requests, based on which files are updated.
# The file reads (line by line) like this:
#     "Files matching <this file pattern> get automatically reviewed by <this GitHub team>"
#
# If you don't specify at least one pattern+team on this repo:
# - Pull requests will not get approvers automatically assigned. 
# - Branch protection policies that require approval by a CODEOWNER will never be satisfied and no pull requests can be merged.
# 
# In most cases, this file will be a single line, specifying that everything (*) is reviewed by a single team (@Paylocity/<yourteam>)
# In some cases (like monorepos), the file will have multiple rows with specific file patterns that, if matched, add the team associated with those file patterns as reviewers on pull requests.
#
# GitHub teams are listed here (for the Paylocity organization): https://github.com/orgs/Paylocity/teams
# You can switch out "Paylocity" in that URL for other organizations within the Paylocity enterprise account.
#
# Full documentation about the format and function of CODEOWNERS files can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners.
#
# Things to check for (i.e., common mistakes and best practices):
# - Only reference GitHub Teams, and not individuals (best practice)
# - Team names have to be qualified with the GitHub organization name (i.e., don't just say "sdo" as the team name, say "@Paylocity/sdo")
# - Team names in this file are GitHub team names, not Active Directory group names (although AD groups and teams may be synced)
# - Don't forget that the first part of each line is the file matching pattern...you can't just put in team name and be done with it.
